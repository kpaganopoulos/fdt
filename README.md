In assignment 4 we managed to load and analyse a CSV file. More specifically, we launched psql from the command line, connected to the database server, made a new database for the CSV data and connected to it, created a table for the CSV data and loaded them to it. Lastly, we run some queries on our dataset and finally export the result of one of the queries to a new CSV file. Various screenshots were taken through the whole procedure to help the reader understand the purpose of this assignment.

In assignment 5 we managed to create a simple web app. More specifically, we used the Flask server in Python, connected it to our course database using an ORM, and deployed it to the web using Heroku, a hosting platform for web apps. We also used Git, a version control tool used to store and backup source code; this tool was required to deploy code to Heroku.
