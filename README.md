In this assignment we managed to create a simple web app. More specifically, we used the Flask server in Python, connected it to our course database using an ORM, and deployed it to the web using Heroku, a hosting platform for web apps. We also used Git, a version control tool used to store and backup source code; this tool was required to deploy code to Heroku.
